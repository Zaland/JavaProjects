#Installation
Run `javac Main.java` to compile the program. Then simply execute `java 
Main` to run the file and follow onscreen instructions. The program will run 
multiple times until the user decides to choose the quit option or forcibly
shuts down the program

#Files

contains a print function to print the object's details. 

#####Main `(Main.java)`
Contains the code to write to and read to a file. There are two options 
available. The user can either go with choice 1 which will allow them to 
read a file that has already been saved. Otherwise the user can go with 
choice 2 where they can give information to write to a file.
